# Contributing to hashnode-next

## Welcome Contributions!

Thank you for considering contributing to hasnode-next. Your contributions are highly valued and appreciated.

## The basics

- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/pulls).
- If there isn't an issue please _create one_ before any development begins
- If you're working on an issue, please _comment_ on it so that others know you're working on it

## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git switch -c MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

## Installing

hashnode-next uses [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

To set the correct version of PNPM, run `nvm use` from the root. There is a `.nvmrc` file that controls the correct node version.

## Installing dependencies

pnpm install
```
